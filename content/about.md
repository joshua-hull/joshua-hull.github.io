Hi, I'm Joshua. I've been a professional software engineer for just over ten years. Before that I graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I've lived in the Upstate of South Carolina since my high school days.

Professionally, I'm a full stack engineer developing mostly in C# and Blazor. I also have previous experience developing in Java, React, and Python. When time allows I also dabble in DevOps roles and have experience in both AWS and Azure. I also have experience in Kubernetes via my homelab work.

When I'm not in front of a computer I enjoy photography, flying my drone, and spending time with my family.
